### Bitcoin is money for criminals/terrorists/drugs/money laundering
This is my personal favorite objection, in part because there is actually some truth to it, but it totally misses the point.

The fact that Bitcoin is based on a permission-less system means that there is no way to stop anyone from using it for any purpose — even if that purpose is illegal. So that does mean that it can be used by criminal organizations. But it also means that it can be used by anyone *without the permission of the central authority*.

Consider the current administration in Washington. President Biden recently enacted several executive orders aimed at damaging the Second Amendment. What happens if the Biden administration tries to de-bank gun stores? In an environment like that, gun stores could add Bitcoin to their arsenal so that citizens who wish to exercise their Constitutional rights can still do so, in the face of a deeply hostile administration.

Similarly, Bitcoin has been extremely helpful in other countries where the central government is outwardly hostile to their citizens rights. [In Venezuela, Hong Kong, Russia, Burma, and many other places, Bitcoin is seen as the best escape hatch from a tyrannical regime].

Bitcoin does not care what you use it for! So, yes, Bitcoin can be used for “criminal activity,” but what happens if that “criminal activity” is something that really shouldn’t be illegal to begin with?

Finally, it should be mentioned that this argument contains the assumption that governmental money *isn’t* used for criminal activity. Of course this is absurd. In 2018, [Danske Bank laundered about €200 billion] in Russian money. And US banks have been reported to have knowingly [laundered over $2 Trillion] between 1999 and 2017, with almost [$400 billion alone to Mexican drug cartels by Wachovia (now Wells Fargo)].
