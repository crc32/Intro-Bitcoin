## Other Cryptocurrencies
When you start learning about Bitcoin, you will discover that there are many other cryptocurrencies. Be extremely careful here! Nothing else comes close to Bitcoin, even though there is usually much marketing hype about them.

Opinions on the other cryptocurrencies differ, but they are all significantly more risky than Bitcoin. In addition, none of them possess the hard money aspects of Bitcoin, and so are not likely to retain their value long term.

Before we go further here, keep in mind that there is only one true Bitcoin, and it is represented on exchanges (like a stock ticker) as either BTC or XBT.

Alt-coins (non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies) like Etherium (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), & Tron (TRX), all attempt to provide other utilities than what Bitcoin does. The main problem with these is that every one sacrifices one or more of Bitcoin’s fundamental core attributes in the name of efficiency or to build in needless complexity. Trading these can be very dangerous, and is beyond the scope of this document.

You will also discover that there are Bitcoin clones (also called forks) like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). **THESE ARE WIDELY REGARDED AS TOTAL SCAMS** and you should definitely avoid anything trying to pass itself off as Bitcoin.

If you want to go down this path, there is ample information on the Internet that can help, but you should definitely do your homework, because much of what has been discussed herein won’t apply to the alt-coin market.
